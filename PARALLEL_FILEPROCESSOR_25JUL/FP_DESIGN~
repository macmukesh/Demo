COMPONENT: P01
Desc: this component will classfiy file into respective queue as defined in reference file.  
			psuedocode for same is described below 

Input: Input Location where pool of file will be stored by external program
Output:  Output location where file will be classified as per configuration in reference file ...
*/

// files can be of text/xls/pdf format to read

xls format: external program must convert it into csv format since csv format is comma separated file
pdf format: since each pdf format might have different format ...we need to write program to convert this pdf into delimited text file
encrypted file: decryption to be done by external program

1: Lookup for file in input directory
2: if file found then go to 3 else go to 9
3: open the file 
4: decide on filecd based on file format on input file 
5: if filecd is identified succesfully then  ..go to 7
6: if filecd is invalid then move that file to reject area...go to 8
7: rename file with filecd+bankcd ...move file to respective Q-AREA
8: move file to reject area
9: go to 1

Desc: this program will convert file into buffer of rawdata.  
			psuedocode for same is described below 

Input: file with valid format
Output: rawdata converted into single transaction to be processed 
*/

DEFINE WIP_DATA TO BE HOLD RAWDATA

0: create row in FILE_INFO struct ...log file parameter into it
1: open the file 
2: bulk read from file and append to WIP_DATA...if EOF then go to 9
3: prepare single txn from array and placed into buffer..
4: move unread data into start of WIP_DATA
9: close the file

			psuedocode for same is described below 

Input: rawdata,filecd

*/

1: identify parsercd ...if valid then set parsercd else set parsercd=0
2: if parsercd<>0 then get next slotno of inmemory tank...set into buffer

Desc: this program will convert single txn into single record.  
			psuedocode for same is described below 

Input: rawdata,sizeof rawdata,parsercd,tankseqno
Output: rawdata converted into single record mapped into tank 
*/

1:parse rawdata into struct
2:enrich struct with external data
3:store struct into in-memory tank at location:tankseqno 
4:update fileinfo
